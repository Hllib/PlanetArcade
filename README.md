# PlanetArcade
This is my first single-handedly developed game.

Planet Arcade features exciting space adventures in both 3D and 2D.

The development process involved skills in 2D:
  - creating level design;
  - working with animations; 
  - creating motion logic; 
  - setup of AI;
  
 As well as skills in 3D:
  - layout and construction of 3D locations;
  - creating cutscenes and working with Cinemachine timeline; 
  - setting up the 3D player controller;
 
The game presents a wide variaty of UI elements and required:
  - creating HUD for player and enemies;
  - immersive inventory system with hover-tooltips and drag-and-drop of elements;
  - various menus and panels, dynamic interactable buttons and shop system;
  - loading streaming assets and resources; 
  - creating sound control panel;

The game also uses Ink - narrative scripting language for games, thus was created a dialogue system with branching options.
FMOD Studio is used for managing all of the audio in the project.

The game is production-ready, however there are still many issues to be considered and there's a lot of space for improvement.

Here are some screenshots from "Planet Arcade" v0.1.0:
