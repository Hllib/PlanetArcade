You've made it here, that's great! Now, we have a little problem here.....
WHERE IS THE KEY?! Ok, listen, I'm sorry to have yelled at you...
I gather that first pirat you met might have a key. 
I will have to open a portal for you. And don't ask me how. 
Okey-dokey... aha, wonderful! Now go find the key!
