Great! In chests you may found ammo, weapons, gold and other useful stuff. Grab that pistol from the chest.
Now, to equip it, open your inventory by pressing 'I' button, then drag your new fancy pistol to one of the slots in the left bottom corner.
From there just press 1, 2 or 3 to select the weapon and you're good to go.
Oh, yes, you're gonna need some ammo to shoot, of course. I definetely saw a box with ammo here some time ago. 
Look around, it has to be somewhere here.
