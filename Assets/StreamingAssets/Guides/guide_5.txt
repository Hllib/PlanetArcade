Hello!...1...2...3...
Ah! Finally I can hear you! Remember me? It seems like you're doing pretty well and learned some tricks since we last met. Anyway, listen, there's some trouble ahead. You’re going to meet some serious enemies there. Those are cosmic pirates, and they will want to secure the artifact we are looking for. They have powerful weapons and can fire at you from the distance, so you’ll need some extra help. 
Now, this particular shield will defend you as long as it is activated, but remember that it has a cool down and won’t be able to protect you entirely! Hold SPACE to activate the shield.
You can read all you need about it in your inventory any time. Good luck!
